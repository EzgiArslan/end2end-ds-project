[Credit card fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud) is used for this project. This dataset includes 1 million data and 8 features. It is an unbalanced dataset. There is only 8% of the data is not fraud. But, Logistic Regression model got 0.99 accuracy.

When you run the fraud-detection.ipynb you get the model as model.pkl and, preprocessing operations as preprocess.pkl for later use.
